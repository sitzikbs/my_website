<p>In this episode of the <a href="https://www.itzikbs.com/the-talking-papers-podcast" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Talking Papers Podcast</a>, I hosted Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo to chat about his paper “DORi: Discovering Object Relationships for Moment Localization of a Natural Language Query in a Video”, published in WACV 2021. Cristian is currently a Research Fellow at the Australian Institute of Machine Learning (AIML) and before that (where I first met him) a PhD student at the Australian National University (ANU). Cristian is a good friend and an amazing researcher. His perspective on video processing is so unique and grounded in hands-on experience. Recording this first episode with him was a pleasure. DORi takes on the task of temporal moment localization in untrimmed videos using a natural language query. The major player here is the Spatio-temporal graph.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This paper studies the task of temporal moment localization in a long untrimmed video using natural language query. Given a query sentence, the goal is to determine the start and end of the relevant segment within the video. Our key innovation is to learn a video feature embedding through a language-conditioned message-passing algorithm suitable for temporal moment localization which captures the relationships between humans, objects and activities in the video. These relationships are obtained by a spatial subgraph that contextualized the scene representation using detected objects and human features. Moreover, a temporal sub-graph captures the activities within the video through time. Our method is evaluated on three standard benchmark datasets, and we also introduce YouCook II as a new benchmark for this task. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, confirming the effectiveness of our approach </p>
