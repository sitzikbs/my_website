<p>If you are new to this topic or find it interesting I totally recommend it.</p>
<p>The awesome Andrew Ng teaches the basics in a very interesting way, giving tons of application examples and not spending too much time on the mathematical proofs.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that it’s absolutely FREE!  So why not give it a shot?</p>
<p>Here is the link:</p>

<p>Now I’m going to try and learn something about these Deep Neural Networks that everyone is buzzing about…</p>
