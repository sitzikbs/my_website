<p>In this episode of the <a href="https://www.itzikbs.com/the-talking-papers-podcast" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Talking Papers Podcast</a>, I hosted<a href="http://www.yiconghong.me/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Yicong Hong</a> to chat about his paper “VLN BERT: A Recurrent Vision-and-Language BERT for Navigation”, published in CVPR 2021. In this paper, they take on the task of vision and language navigation (VLN) and propose a time-aware recurrent BERT model. The recurrent function maintains the cross-modal state information for the agent, enabling them to achieve state-of-the-art results. When I started my postdoc position at ANU, Yicong was in the first year of his PhD. Since then, it was a delight to see him grow as a researcher. One of the things I love most about his style is his relentlessness, he won’t let it go until he figures it out (reminds me of someone…). Yicong is a great early career researcher (soon to complete his PhD) and it was a pleasure recording this episode with him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Accuracy of many visiolinguistic tasks has benefited significantly from the application of vision-and-language (V&amp;L) BERT. However, its application for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) remains limited. One reason for this is the difficulty adapting the BERT architecture to the partially observable Markov decision process present in VLN, requiring history-dependent attention and decision making. In this paper, we propose a recurrent BERT model that is time-aware for use in VLN. Specifically, we equip the BERT model with a recurrent function that maintains cross-modal state information for the agent. Through extensive experiments on R2R and REVERIE we demonstrate that our model can replace more complex encoder-decoder models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to other transformer-based architectures, supports pre-training, and is capable of solving navigation and referring expression tasks simultaneously.</p>
