<p>This Wednesday (27.12.17) I gave a talk in the  Omek-3D academia conference about my work on 3D point cloud classification.  The conference took place at Daniel Hotel in Herzliya, Israel.</p>
<p>In a previous Omek-3D classification forum I presented some <a href="https://www.itzikbs.com/3d-point-cloud-classification-using-deep-learning" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent work</a> on point cloud classification using deep learning, this time I presented our (<a href="https://meeng.technion.ac.il/members/anath-fischer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Anath Fischer</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~mic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Michael Lindenbaum</a> and me) approach on the subject. This talk included a short primer about Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), also available <a href="https://www.itzikbs.com/gaussian-mixture-model-gmm-3d-point-cloud-classification-primer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here,</a>  a primer about Fisher Vectors (FV), which will also be available here soon, and a short description of our method which includes the 3DmFV representation, 3D point cloud classification network (3DmFV-Net), and part-segmentation extension. Our approach is presented in detail in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our paper</a> “3D Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation using 3D Modified Fisher Vector Representation for Convolutional Neural Networks”. Luckily, the amazing Ronit Schneor took some pictures exactly in the right slides (where I am presenting 3DmFV and 3DmFV-Net – see my hands ? ).</p>

<p>The conference had many great talks. I personally liked the following talks</p>
<ul>
<li>“Modifying Non-Local Variations Across Multiple Views”  given by the always fascinating <a href="http://lihi.eew.technion.ac.il/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Lihi Zelnik-Manor</a> from Technion IIT.</li>
<li>“Convolutional Neural Nets on Surfaces” given by <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/meirav/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Meirav Galun</a> from Weizmann Institute.</li>
<li>“Point Cloud Registration using Large Triangles” given by <a href="https://is-web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/website-ilan-shimshoni" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Ilan Shimshoni</a> From Haifa University (<a href="https://is-web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/images/lecturers_files/ishimshoni_files/3dV_15.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">link to paper</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We signed off the day with an amazing view of a Mediterranean sunset.</p>
