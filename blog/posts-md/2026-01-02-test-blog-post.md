## Testing the Blog Post Template

This is a **test blog post** to verify that our new 11ty blog post template works correctly with Markdown content.

### What We're Testing

1. **Markdown Rendering** - Does basic Markdown work?
2. **Links** - Do [links work](/)?
3. **Images** - Can we embed images?
4. **Formatting** - Bold, italic, etc.

### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item  
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote to test formatting.
> It should look nice and styled.

### Conclusion

If you can see this properly formatted with the blog hero section above, the template is working! ✅

We can add syntax highlighting for code blocks later in Phase 4.
