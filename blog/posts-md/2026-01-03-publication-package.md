### Post Content:

🎉 New Year, New Website!

After years of dealing with WordPress plugin updates, broken themes, and security headaches, I finally migrated my entire website to a modern static site—and I did it with the help of AI coding agents.

The results? 
✅ 74 blog posts migrated to Markdown
✅ 78.3% reduction in image sizes (107MB → 23MB)
✅ Build time: 1.3 seconds
✅ Deployment on Cloudflare Pages
✅ All while keeping my existing content intact

But here's what really made this work:

🔹 PARALLELIZATION: Running multiple AI agents on independent tasks simultaneously
🔹 HIGH-QUALITY CODE: Getting expert-level code in areas where I had little experience
🔹 RAPID ITERATION: Quick debugging and fixes through conversation
🔹 DOCUMENTATION: Impeccable docs that made it easy to jump back in after breaks

The 9-step workflow I developed:
1. Plan mode with high-level work packages
2. Refine into self-contained tasks
3. Create dependency graphs for parallel work
4. Open GitHub issues for tracking
5. Launch agents in parallel
6. Manual inspection and testing
7. Deployment with detailed instructions
8. Security audits
9. Final SEO tweaks

What surprised me most? It felt like managing a team of talented engineers—giving direction, reviewing work, and keeping things moving. As someone used to working with PhD students on repos, this was familiar territory, just amplified.

The kicker? All of this used <20% of my GitHub Copilot Pro subscription ($40/month). That's some serious ROI.

If you've been putting off a migration or redesign project because it feels overwhelming, maybe it's time to let AI agents help. The tools are here, and they work.

The old way: WordPress was great in 2010. By 2025? Constant plugin updates, broken themes, security patches, outdated design.

The thought of migrating while keeping all my content felt overwhelming. So I didn't... until AI agents made it actually fun.

1. Plan mode: Break project into work packages
2. Refine: Make each task self-contained
3. Dependency graph: Identify parallel work
4. GitHub issues: Track everything
5. Launch agents in parallel
6. Manual review & testing
7. Deploy with AI-generated instructions
8. Security audit
9. SEO optimization

The real unlock? PARALLELIZATION.

Running multiple agents on independent tasks = what would've taken weeks took days.

It felt like managing a team of talented engineers. Give direction, review work, iterate. Familiar territory, just amplified.

**Tweet 5:**
Even better: the documentation was impeccable.

I stretched this project over weeks. Usually, getting "back into" code is painful. Not this time. A quick chat with the agent and I was up to speed instantly.

**Tweet 6:**
Tech details for the nerds:
• Eleventy (11ty) static site generator
• 1,847 images downloaded & optimized
• WebP conversion with responsive sizes
• CSS/JS minification
• Schema.org + Open Graph
• Cloudflare Pages deployment

All automated with npm build scripts ⚡️

**Tweet 7:**
Personal note: This felt like chatting on ICQ as a kid, but with code instead of gossip. 😄

If you've been putting off a migration/redesign, maybe let AI agents help. The tools exist. They work. And they might actually make it enjoyable.
