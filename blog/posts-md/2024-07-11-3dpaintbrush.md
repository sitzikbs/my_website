<p>We are excited to introduce <strong>3D Paintbrush</strong>, a novel method for local stylization of 3D shapes using cascaded score distillation. This research explores innovative approaches to applying artistic styles to 3D geometry while maintaining structural integrity.</p>
<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
<p>Our method enables artists and researchers to selectively apply different styles to specific regions of 3D objects, opening up new possibilities for creative expression in 3D content creation.</p>
<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
<p>The cascaded score distillation framework allows for fine-grained control over the stylization process, balancing between artistic expression and geometric fidelity.</p>
